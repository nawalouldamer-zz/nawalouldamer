Hi, I'm Eugene Yan. I design, build, and operate machine learning systems that serve customers at scale. I also write and speak about ML systems, engineering, and career.

I'm currently a Senior Applied Scientist at Amazon, shipping ML and recommender systems to help customers read more. Here, I built real-time retrieval, bandit-based ranking, and recsys in search. I also shared our work at a RecSys keynote.

Previously, I led machine learning at Lazada (acquired by Alibaba in 2016). I also built the product ranking system (conversion & revenue up 5-20%), smart push-notifications (CTR & add-to-cart up 10%), and automated product & review classification (cost down 90%). Hypergrowth's fun!

As an early hire in a healthtech Series A, I led the team to ship an ML system for Southeast Asia's largest healthcare provider. At IBM, I built job forecasts & recommendations.

Outside of work, I share the ghost knowledge of applying ML via curated papers, guides, and practitioner interviews, and host a monthly meetup on ML in industry. I also angel invest in early-stage data/ML, infra, and devtool startups.
